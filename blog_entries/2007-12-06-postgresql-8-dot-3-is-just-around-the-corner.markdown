**8.3 upcoming Highlights**

8.3 has numerous highlights just as previous versions, but we shall focus on our favorite ones.


# Support Security Service Provider Interface (SSPI) for authentication on Windows - which presumably will allow PostgreSQL databases to enjoy the same single signon you get with Microsoft SQL Server 7-2005.
# GSSAPI with Kerberos authentication as a new and improved authentication scheme for single signon
# Numerous performance improvements - too many to itemize
# The new QUERY functionality in plpgsql which offers a simpler way of returning result sets
# Scrollable cursors in PLPgSQL
# Improved shared buffers on windows
# TSearch - Full Text Search is now integrated into PostgreSQL instead of being a contrib module
# Support for SQL/XML and new XML datatype
# ENUM datatype
# New add-on feature to PgAdmin III - a PL debugger most compliments of EnterpriseDB
