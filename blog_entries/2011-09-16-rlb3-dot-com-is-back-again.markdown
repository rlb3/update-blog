<p>RLB3.COM is back after a two months of being down. I've tried many diffenent linux hosts and blogging providers and I've decided I don't like any of them. The main thing I needed for my domain was to blog so I've gone with cheap and popular. For now I will use wordpress because its API is used by many clients plus I wanted to try out org2blog, which I am using right now. I hope to be more regular in my posting. I also hope they will be useful to someone. </p> <p> I've tried making my blog specific to computers or music before and that doesn't  work. So this will be a hodge-podge of topics I find intresting. Well, thanks for reading and talk to you later. </p>
