Languages like Smalltalk and Lisp (always got to give Lisp its props) are amplifiers. They make you more of whatever it is that you already are. If you're a bad programmer, they're going to make you worse, they'll let you shoot your foot off in more interesting ways than you can imagine.

If you're a great programmer, they're going to make you that much greater, they're going to let you become a God, and live entirely in a universe of your own abstractions. Anything you don't like you can objectify or macro'fy and never have to think about it again.
