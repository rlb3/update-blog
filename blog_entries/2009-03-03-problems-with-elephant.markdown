I've run into a problem with elephant. The first time I try to create a persistent object. It throws an error and I end up in the debugger. If I retry everything works as expected. I'm not sure if it's a problem with my configuration or what but there is obviously something wrong. Now back to reading through the docs to see if I can find a solution there.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
