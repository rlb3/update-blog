From reading around it seems that the "Hello World" app of common lisp is a reddit clone. So I'm <a href="http://github.com/rlb3/scripts/blob/08444b4967eb1ca8ef4ba2e881815a2d664a12fb/links.lisp">throwing my hat in to the ring</a>. It's not finished but have to say that writing this simple web app using lisp tools has been nice. Using an object database has been an interesting experience and it seems at least a great way to prototype an app and give more thought to the data store once you know more about the dynamics of the application.<div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/1621466996203250312-6904785438660581678?l=learning-lisp.blogspot.com' alt='' /></div>
