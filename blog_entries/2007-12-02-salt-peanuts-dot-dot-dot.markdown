bq. You must have read what Shakespeare said back in a distant age.
"All the worlds a stage and the men a women in it, merely players."
You are the actors in this fast moving drama, you are the factors in
the world's panarama. The worlds a stage and lifes a play, so you
must be certain at the rise of the curtain, weither you'll stand in the
balcony with your cigerete butts or sit in the orchestra with Dizzy and
Salt peanuts.
