I'm looking for an off-site backup system... Amazon's "S3":http://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html?node=16427261 looks pretty good and there is a "perl interface":http://search.cpan.org/dist/Net-Amazon-S3/ and a "ruby interface":http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom/2007/02/01. I like the ruby interface better but then there is "Brackup":http://brad.livejournal.com/2207608.html which might be a good choice. Still looking...
