I started the day with *Timecruiser Corporate Presentation -- Portals for mortals*. This was a decent talk given by the two Daves. One Dave was a peon the other was a vice president. This was the first time I looked at CampusCruiser. It seamed to be pretty customizable in the design/css sense, not the programmable sense. There were two things that I thought were interesting.

# They support single sign on with moodle (an open source learning management system).
# They are building their own course management system into CampusCruiser.

And to honest I thought there CMS was much better that blackboard.

Next was *HiJax Your UniData Data to the web*. I don't remember their names but they called themselves *code monkeys*. Basicly, the presented a way of pulling data out of unidata using tomcat/.jsp as middle ware providing XML to the calling program. They showed us an example of one of there web sites and seems to work well and preformance was good too. The best part was they gave us some of there source code. I'll have to see if I can *talk* Raymond into letting be try it.

Then there was *Upgrading to Web 2.0*. This was the best talk I attended today. His talk was very well formatted and structured. The other talks were mostly run by people that you could tell were a little uncomfortable talking in front of people. The best quote from him was _"I don't buy the false religion of PHP"_. He showed us some of his ajax based web apps that pulled data out of unidata. One site made use of an applying student's preferred address and made a Frapper type map of there locations. He did other things with directory and a google suggest like interface. I plan to go to his next talk tomorrow.

Then I went to *Cascading Style Sheets for WebAdvisor 3.0*. The whole time I'm thinking I've been here before. It really wasn't that informative. Most of the information you can find by looking in .css files.

*Web Single Sign On (beta) with Version 3's Simple Sign-On*. This talked wasn't what I expected. I didn't get much out of it.
