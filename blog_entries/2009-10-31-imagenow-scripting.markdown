Well, we just finished lunch and it's not what the manual lead me to belive. So far we have just had a powerpoint on some features of ImageNow and where we could using scripting. The next part of class we'll implament a workflow and over the next couple of days add scripts to it. Not exactly what I was looking for, but it may get better.
