Sorry to disappoint, but today was worthless. The talks just weren't worth reporting on. But I did see some of the city today. Washington is a lot bigger than I thought it was. I didn't see very much of it but I did see the Washington Monument, the WWII Monument, the  Lincoln Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, and the Air "and" Space Museum.
