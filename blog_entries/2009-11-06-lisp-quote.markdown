Pascal is for building pyramids -- imposing, breathtaking, static structures <br>
built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp is for building<br>
organisms -- imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads<br>
fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place.<br>
- Alan J. Perils<br><br>
