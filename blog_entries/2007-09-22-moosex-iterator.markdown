Well I'm trying to write my first Moose metaclass. "MooseX::Iterator":http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/MooseX-Iterator/trunk/ gives a smalltalk stream-like access to your Moose collections. Right now it only works with arrayrefs but I hope add hashes and I hope to move it to "MooseX-AttributeHelpers":http://code2.0beta.co.uk/moose/svn/MooseX-AttributeHelpers/ at some point.
