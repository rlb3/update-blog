I've been a "Red Hat":http://www.redhat.com guy for a long time. I even have my RHCE. But it's time I learned other linux systems. "Ubuntu":http://www.ubuntu.com/ systems are very popular and it would nice if knew something about them. I still think Red Hat and Fedora are very worth while, but I can't let that stop me from learning something new.
