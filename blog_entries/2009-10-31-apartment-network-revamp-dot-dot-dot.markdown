Well, I have decide to put some of this book learning to good use and have setup my home LAN in a more Unix like way. I don't want to give a way to much, for the crackers out there, but I think I have setup a secure site. I even put the wireless router behind another router just for the heck of it. All I can say is linux is the stuff! Anyway, more to come...
