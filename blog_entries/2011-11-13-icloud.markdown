Funny how just adding the ability to sync between all my idevices makes apps so much more useful. I had down loaded all the iWork apps for iPad. O never used them. I used pages when I was taking a music business class in fall 2010 but that was the only exception. Now that I can sync between my iPad and iPhone over the air I think I will be using them more often.
