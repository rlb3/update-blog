Right now the instructor and the one of the students, who is also works for imagenow, are talking trash about linux. I guess there is always a snake in the garden. They talk like mysql is the only opensource database. I think this is where mysql popularity does OSS a disservice in bussiness. Looking at the lack of features and general imaturity of it's view, trigger, and PL just make all OSS seem not usable for enterprise uses. I'm not saying the mysql is bad, I just wish more people knew about postgresql and firebird.
