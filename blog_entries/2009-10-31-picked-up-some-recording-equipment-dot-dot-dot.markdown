I need to get back into playing. So today I picked to two things to help me combine two things I love. Computers and music. I got a "M-Audio Firewire Solo":http://www.m-audio.com/products/en_us/FireWireSolo-main.html and a "audio-technica AT3035":http://www.zzounds.com/item--AUTAT3035 mic. The mic is expressive. I really like it. Now to practice...
