I going to start a blog series on Plain Text and the tools used to store your life's information in it. Plain text is the most flexible mediums to store you data in mainly because of the ability to switch in and out of structure. Using that ability it is possible to embody any action or thought. Just like writing by hand.
<div id="outline-container-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Topics</h2>
<div id="text-1" class="outline-text-2">

Over the next couple of blogs I plan to start off with these two subjects.

<dl><dt>What is plain text</dt><dd>The basics of plain text.</dd><dt>A text editor</dt><dd>This is perhaps the most important and personal choice when dealing with plain text.</dd><dt>A markup language</dt><dd>From markdown to org-mode , markup languages gives your text structure when you need it and the ability to convert to other document formats.</dd><dt>Revision Control</dt><dd>This allows you to track changes to a document over time. It also let's you work with others and not over-write each others changes.<dl><dt>Branching</dt><dd>Branching is a very important part of revision control that allows you to track two or more lines of progress.</dd></dl></dd></dl>I don't know how in depth I will get but I hope they will be useful. Also I have an emacs bias so be prepared.
