These's people have an awesome company. They have a slide. It starts on the second floor and goes to the first. They was a news article with a quote from the CEO that said, "I hate turnover". What a novel idea. They get bonuses like $500 gift certificates. I would like to work here...

%{color:blue}*UPDATE:*%
They have seqways and xboxes on 50 inch screen tv's for brake. That sure beats a trip to the JBK. I am so depressed. :(
