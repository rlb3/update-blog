Well, Wes and I have made to Shawnee, Kansas. And we are bright and early for our first day. The instuctor isn't here yet but we helped ourselves to the class manual. The content look pretty complete. I was afraid the class would be mostly about the their added objects to ECMAScript, but it appears to cover more the basics. Just looking at the table of contents it doesn't seem to cover building your own objects. That is a little disappointing but to be expected. I think it could be a good week.

Looking more at the manual, there will be one chapter on objects.

The instuctor seems to have an anti-unix bias. So much for this being a good week.
