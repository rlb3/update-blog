Ok... I'm trying to blog again. I really liked the typo blog engine but it is too unstable. So I think I'm sticking with Movable Type. I will try to import the old entries when I get time.

<div class="zemanta-pixie" style="margin-top:10px;height:15px;"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=e1a9b35d-d80b-4950-950a-894e89813ece" style="border:none;float:right;"><span class="zem-script more-related pretty-attribution"></span></div>
