Around 2005 I told myself I wanted to learn lisp. I started learning ruby instead. In 2006 I bought practical common lisp and didn't read it. Finally, in the summer of 2008 I learned emacs and at last started to learn common lisp.<div><br /></div><div>This blog is where I will record what I learn.</div><div class="blogger-post-footer"><img width='1' height='1' src='' alt='' /></div>
