Yes, I know its been a while since my
last post, but I've been busy. Busy with
what you ask? Stuff, lots and lots of
stuff. The only new computer news I have
is that I'm converting the site from
php/mysql to perl/postgresql. I find the
latter suites me more. And I've also
been learning about CGI::Application. I may
have to use that on something in the
near future.
