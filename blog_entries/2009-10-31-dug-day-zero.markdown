This was my first real day at the conference. The first thing I noticed was the people treated each class as one of two types.

# Run by datatel
# Not run by datatel

During the question sections people would just lay into them. Seemly trying to make the datatel people cry.

The first class I went was *R18 New Release System*. The guys talk went well, only a few problems with his presentation. But he was from datatel so during the question, off came his head. The most memorable event was one woman that didn't understand the purpose of the code revision version and the fact that you can back changes out once you had applied an update. I thought for a second she was going to rush the stage.

Then I went to the *R18 Migration* class. This one wasn't run by datatel so the crowd was much more pleasant. Questions we asked but no blood was letted.

After lunch was the *Running Colleague on Linux* class. The class was good. The guys talking ware really honest about their problems. Plus they gave us little penguins. Another cool thing was that they wrote there own web student information app. I look much better than web advisor and had much more functionality.

Next was the *Intergrating Web Services with WebAdvisor and Novell Products*. I know what you're thinking. I went because I wanted to see how they the got the data out of Datatel and Novell. Their solution won't working for us because they have oracle as a backend database and can query it directly.

The last talk was *Troubleshooting WebAdvisor 3.0*. This was also a datatel talk so I expected the worst, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. I guess people were tired and wanted to leave so they didn't bother these guys so much. There talk was good but a little boring and there attempts to make little jokes didn't work. But I will download the powerpoint for future reference.

Over all an interesting first day. People really have some issues with datatel but at the end of the day they are still datatel clients(and may God have mercy on their souls).
