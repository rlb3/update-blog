Just in case you've not heard of him. Why_ is a very active member of the ruby community. He has written many modules. For example:
* "YAML":http://stdlib.rubyonrails.org/libdoc/yaml/rdoc/index.html
* "Camping":http://camping.rubyforge.org/files/README.html
* "Markaby":http://markaby.rubyforge.org/

He also has two ruby tutorials.
* "why's (poignant) guide to Ruby":http://poignantguide.net/ruby/
* "Try Ruby":http://tryruby.hobix.com/

He has many web sites, but the one I use the most is "RedHanded":http://redhanded.hobix.com/.

why_ is a lunatic that you have to keep your "eye":http://hoodwinkd.hobix.com/ on.
